# Vision Statement
Swapper is a bartering application that allows anyone to exchange items with others instead of using cash. Unlike Kjiji or Craigslist, Swapper makes it fun and easy to trade your used items with others. Our target audience is someone who desires a new way to buy and sell used items.

A user can create postings of items they would like to swap, then other users will be able to see the listing. In order for a user to post a listing they must have an account. A listing is composed of at least one image of the item, a short description and the user’s swappable rating, preferred time and place for the swap.

Users can easily find items up for exchange. They can search for other users and items, filter items by categories or a user’s rating, and use a fun and engaging way to browse items in their area. 

A user must create an account if they want to swap items with someone. An account enables a user to acquire a listing history of their past swaps, a swappable rating so others know swapping with them is a good experience, and allows setting up preferred public meeting spots and times for swapping items so users can skip right to meeting up and swapping.

Swapper may also allow users who live far apart to organize mailing and tracking items they want to swap with each other. 

Swapper creates significant value for the user as Swapper allows you to swap items based on the users’ idea of a good trade. It provides an innovative interface for finding items of interest. Compared to its competitors, it simplifies finding a time and place to meet. Swapper’s rating system makes it easy to find high-quality swaps. By eliminating money from the transaction, users can focus on the things they have and the things they want. Users can take things they no longer use and swap them for items they want.

Swapper will be considered a success based on four criteria. First, the number of products posted for swapping reaches 100,000. Second, 100 successful swaps occur per day amongst users. Thirdly, the time required for users to organize a time and place to meet is reduced by 25% when compared to competitors. Finally, on average, the users enjoy using the swipe-style navigation better when compared to competitors’ methods of navigation.

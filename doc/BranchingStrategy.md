We are using GitHub flow as our branching strategy. There are 6 Steps to it.

1. Create a branch - Give it a descriptive name
2. Add commits - Make changes on the branch and use commit messages
3. Open a pull request - Invite discussion on your commits
4. Discuss and review code - Discuss the commits with others
5. Deploy - Fix errors that could occur when mergin back into the master branch
6. Merge - Finalize the merge into master. Leaving a history of the decisions

## Preparation

Prior to starting to the retrospective, we outlined the important changes to the marking scheme for iteration 3. We ensured that everyone knew missing or broken items, and code smells are heavily penalized, and that we need to use Mockito DOCs when testing. Because of these changes, we agreed that we should have all code merged by Wednesday so we had Thursday to verify nothing is broken and can then finish any artifacts to hand in such as the web page, presentation, etc.

## Retrospective

### Silent deliberation

We first started by silently and anonymously adding items to the four categories: "what went well?", "what can be improved?", "What new ideas do we have?". After adding about 2 each, we began to discuss each item.

### Discussion

#### What went well?

For what went well, we talked about how we did communicate more effectively than iteration 1. We finished most of iteration 2's work on Thursday which gave us time to update the architecture and other documentation earlier than the last moment. We were more focused on the user stories that we set out to complete; we didn't begin development on issues that weren't required yet unlike iteration 1. We congratulated ourselves on cleaner git branching compared to iteration 1 which was very messy. We also began using gitlab's comments more so our conversations about merge requests and issues were better documented.

#### What can be improved?

We found the part of the project that didn't go well throughout iteration 2 and even iteration 1 was using git and gitlab. We talked about how we can improve on how small we're making tasks so we can merge more often. We talked about making our git commits more descriptive, code reviewing sooner than we have been, tracking our time spent more accurately.

#### New ideas?

The only new idea we discussed about was creating a development branch to work based on instead of the master branch. This makes it easier to continue development into the next iteration so we don't need to worry about merging changes that break the working system to be delivered on the deadlines.

#### Actions to take?

We decided to tackle time tracking by updating the amount of time spent immediately after we finished working on something for the day. Or if we can't access gitlab, we track it on a piece of paper locally and add it once we're ready to merge into the development branch. We decided to measure success based on having up to date time tracking information once the merge request for the issue is created for every issue.

We wanted to tackled git branch naming so we agreed on using the scheme of `<issue-number>-name-of-issue` for all our branches. Success was measured based on how many branches followed this scheme and we'd be successful if every branch made followed it.

The final thing we wanted to tackle was more breaking our tasks into smaller tasks and figured we succeeded if we broke each user story up into a minimum of 3 development tasks.
